This is a Python module for control of GW-Instek PSP-603 power supply units
over a serial interface.  It requires pySerial to be installed, and a recent
(2.6 or newer) version of Python.

Note that a special cable may be necessary to interface with the power
supplies (they are optoisolated, so voltage is needed from the computer's
serial port for communications to work).  The power supplies communicate
at 2400 baud.


To install:

# python setup.py install


Example:

#!/usr/bin/python

# Set output voltage to 6.5v, enable output and print the output current

import serial
from psp603 import PSP603

device = serial.Serial("/dev/ttyS0", 2400)
psu = PSP603(device)

psu.voltage = 6.5
psu.relay = True

print psu.current
